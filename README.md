# Attackers-From-Space
This was the largest project I worked on during my senior year of high school. I collaborated with a few friends to create a game similar to Galaga. The is shown on an HTML canvas, with instructions and a high score panel placed beside it. To format the high scores panel, I incorporated a Google Firebase Database to store submitted scores by users and then displayed only the top ten players.
