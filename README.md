# Attackers-From-Space
This was the largest project I worked on during my senior year of high school. I collaborated with a few friends to create a game similar to Galaga. The is shown on an HTML canvas, with instructions and a high score panel placed beside it. To format the high scores panel, I incorporated a Google Firebase Database to store submitted scores by users and then displayed only the top ten players.

Unfortunately, Replit has updated its deployment policies so, this program is currently not runnable on public devices. I will deploy this program soon. :(
